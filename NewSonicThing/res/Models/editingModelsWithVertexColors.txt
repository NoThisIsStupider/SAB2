[12:31 AM] NoThisIsStupider: so, to edit a model in sab right now that uses vertex colours, you need to:
[12:31 AM] NoThisIsStupider: -get the custom blender obj importer that does vertex colours, import the model
[12:31 AM] NoThisIsStupider: -make changes you want
[12:31 AM] NoThisIsStupider: -export to dae with texture type set to uv textures
(note from the future: rotate the entire model -90 around the x-axis before exporting as dae)
[12:32 AM] NoThisIsStupider: -import that dae to meshlab and export as obj from there
[12:32 AM] NoThisIsStupider: -fix with the objfixer, but it'll crash because of some mtl thing so comment out that line
(note from the future: use a text editor to find and replace in the .mtl and remove all instances of ".001.png")

process used for metal harbor, hopefully works on other stages

TODO: these instructions are old, replace with very informative and updated ones
